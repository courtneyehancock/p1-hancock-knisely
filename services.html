            <p>We have another website for our bar and gift shop and live music venue: lightninsalvageenterprises.com</p>
            <p>Here you will find a calendar filled with upcoming events, more information on big parties and events in Lightin Savage, and a brief history behind it all. After only 10 short years, Lightnin' Salvage had become the ultimate juke joint:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A junk museum, toy store, Florida souvenir shop.</li>
              <li>A bar, lounge, and live music venue.</li>
              <li>A playground for the kids, people spontaneously dancing, a Lionel train rattling overhead.</li>
              <li>Kids running wild without a parent in sight.</li>
              <li>Birthday parties and a local hangout.</li>

            <h2>Parties</h2>
            <p>People often ask about big parties and reservations. See our Catering link for the full info on reserving space for a party. Below is detailed information for your smaller parties less than 25.</p>

            <p>Lightnin' Salvage Enterprises (LSE) is our gift shop, bar, and live music venue. It seats about 60 people and is a self serve atmosphere with no wait staff. You order at the bar and your food is delivered as take out. This is a great place for groups to gather. If you know you are bringing a big group please just email Satch (SatchelsGville@gmail.com) so we can have staff on hand.</p>

            <p>Lately we’ve been using our bar area as a place to host large lunch parties who have a speaker or power point presentation. We have a screen and projector available. If you let us know you’re coming your group can order separately at the bar or we can cater and have it ready when they arrive.</p>

            <p>While we can always accommodate parties of most sizes, the larger the party the longer the wait could be for Satchel's proper. If you come on a weeknight please check our live music calendar to see who's playing. Some weeknights we have plenty of open seating in LSE. We often have parties of 10-20 in LSE. Coming at 11am on Saturdays is a good time, or before 6 on most nights is usually best if you want to get tables without a wait.</p>

            <p>We have a greenhouse area that seats 15 with a spillover area under the plane that can seat another 40+. This area is often available and can be reserved for large parties by going through the catering link.</p>

            <p>Whatever your party size or plan let us know. We'll work with you. Gracy does catering and can cater onsite or offsite. See the Catering link on this site. We can't accommodate really huge parties (like 100) onsite but we can cater somewhere else up to 150. Gracy knows some spots you can rent and have our food delivered.</p>

            <p>You can bring in your special dessert at no charge but we ask that you do not bring in your own beverages or outside food.</p>
